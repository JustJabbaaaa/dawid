    "header": "I am 56 years old – born and raised in Oranienburg, and therefore deeply rooted in our hometown.",
    "para1": "Sport has shaped me above all. At the age of 8, I started boxing, and later kickboxing. Sport gave me stability, self-confidence, and strength – even in difficult times.",
    "para2": "For many years, I have been involved in children’s and youth work as a coach: not only teaching techniques but also passing on values such as discipline, mutual respect, and responsibility. Right after my training, I chose the path of self-employment. For over 25 years, I have been active as an entrepreneur – in the fields of real estate, personnel management, and services.",
    "paraExpanded": "I have built businesses, created jobs, connected people, and developed solutions where others saw problems. I can say that along this path, I have grown into a strong man and entrepreneur. A consistent stance, reliability, down-to-earth attitude, and loyalty are very important to me. I know what it means to make decisions and bear risks. As a city councilor, I have been particularly involved in urban development and construction – always with the goal of sustainably advancing Oranienburg.",

      "third": "I am running as an independent candidate because I believe in the power of working together – in a city where the best ideas are judged not by party affiliation but by their benefit to the people. I stand for transparency and, above all, closeness to citizens: not just administering, but listening, understanding, and allowing participation. I stand for Oranienburg – with economic expertise, municipal political experience, lived commitment, and above all: a clear inner stance. My goal is a city with heart, mind, and future – a policy of openness, clarity, and cooperation."

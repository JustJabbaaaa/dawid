    "para2": "For more than 25 years, Heiko Zillmann has been active as an entrepreneur – in real estate, HR services, and the service sector. He built companies, created jobs, connected people, and provided solutions where others only saw problems. His perspective has always been grounded: focused on what’s practically achievable – and morally right",

He stands for a new style of leadership: transparent, approachable, unifying. A leadership that listens, understands, moderates – and then takes decisive action.",
      "para2": "His commitment doesn’t stop at city hall. He has made a lasting impact on civic life – especially through his long-standing work with children and youth in martial arts. As a coach, mentor, and role model, he taught not just techniques, but values: discipline, mutual respect, and responsibility – values he lives by himself."

That’s also true in Oranienburg’s historic shooting club, where he quickly became an active member – and shortly after, won the title of Schützenkönig. Not because he aimed for it, but because wherever he goes, he steps up.",
      "para2":"Privately, Heiko is a man with strong family values. He lives in close, harmonious connection with his wife, his son, and his brothers. He maintains friendships with the same reliability he brings to his professional and political life."

            <h1>“I don’t want to polarize –<br/> I want to unite.<br/>I want to be the common<br/>ground we all share.”</h1>
            <h2>This is not a political strategy.<br/>It’s a reflection of who he is.</h2>
            <p>Heiko Zillmann believes in the power of community – in a city where ideas are judged not by the color of a party flag, but by how they serve its people. He stands for a new style of leadership: transparent, approachable, unifying. A leadership that listens, understands, moderates – and then takes decisive action.</p>
            <p>His commitment doesn’t stop at city hall. He has made a lasting impact on civic life – especially through his long-standing work with children and youth in martial arts.
As a coach, mentor, and role model, he taught not just techniques, but values: discipline, mutual respect, and responsibility – values he lives by himself.</p>

            <p>People who know him will tell you: When Heiko commits, he commits fully. That’s also true in Oranienburg’s historic shooting club, where he quickly became an active member – and shortly after, won the title of Schützenkönig. Not because he aimed for it, but because wherever he goes, he steps up.</p>
            <p>Privately, Heiko is a man with strong family values. He lives in close, harmonious connection with his wife, his son, and his brothers. He maintains friendships with the same reliability he brings to his professional and political life.</p>
